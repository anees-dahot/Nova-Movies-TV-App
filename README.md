- ~2 MB release APK, ~40 MB RAM while browsing

## Build
1. Get a free TMDB API key: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
2. Add it to `local.properties` (not committed):
   ```
   tmdb.key=YOUR_KEY
   ```
3. Build: `./gradlew assembleRelease` → `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
4. Install: `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Note
This app does not host any content. It only shows metadata from TMDB/AniList and plays streams from third-party embed providers; availability and legality of those streams depends on your region.
